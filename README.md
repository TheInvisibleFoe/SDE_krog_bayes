# Bayesian Inference and Model check


============================================================================================
   This library holds software intended to be used for the analysis of data sets
   for processes governed by simple Stochastic Differential equation (SDE).

   A sample skeleton file ('SDE_skel.m') demonstrates the software by analysing the 
   "ftrack.txt" data set in the 'samples' directory.

   The plot files 'SDE_plot_like' and 'SDE_plot_inf' generates plots which visualize
   the posterior probability distribution for the parameters and the distribution of 
   information content respectively.

   NB: To execute any of the routines mentioned in MatLab, the directory 'util' must
   be added to the searchpath, which can be done by running the command
   
      "addpath('util')"

   in MatLab.
